THIS MIGHT GIVE A FALSE POSITIVE FROM YOUR ANTIVIRUS
Pyinstaller (the compiler I used) is known for giving false positives.

---HOW TO USE---

MAKE SURE THE .EXE IS INSIDE THE FOLDER, OR ELSE IT WILL CRASH!

This is a recreation of those Find Luigi videos that are trending on Twitter.
It's not playable, it's just for making your own versions of those videos.

The settings for the game can be controlled using the settings.json file.
Inside are a few options so you can adjust the game to your liking.
